                        <h5>Newbie Billiard Player<span> & Gym Addict</span></h5>
                        <p>Hello there! I'm thrilled to introduce myself as a newbie billiard player and an avid gym addict. While I may be relatively new to the world of billiards, I've quickly developed a passion for the game's precision and strategy. I'm eager to learn and improve my skills, and I'm always up for a friendly game of pool.

                            When I'm not at the billiard table, you'll often find me at the gym, where I channel my energy into staying fit and healthy. Whether it's lifting weights, doing cardio, or trying out new workout routines, I'm dedicated to my fitness journey and the positive impact it has on my overall well-being.
                            
                            So, while I may be a newbie on the billiards scene, I bring the same enthusiasm and determination to the game as I do to my workouts. I'm excited to meet fellow billiard enthusiasts and gym addicts, so don't hesitate to connect and share your experiencesâ€”I'm always open to learning and making new friends!
